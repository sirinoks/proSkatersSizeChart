    <!--
  Once the brand of skates or shoes selected -> please enter MM or CM or MONDO / MP in three different fields

    Also, could be good to have a width adjustment option that will highlight the brand that is most suitable...
    Maybe we will also need a drop down of the skate model that the client is considering or something like that.
    If a table is easier, the correct row should be highlighted
